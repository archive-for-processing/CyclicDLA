Cyclic Diffusion-Limited Aggregation is a variant of the Diffusion-Limited Aggregation where once a particle hits the aggregate, a value is added to the aggregation map and, instead of removing the particle, its position is randomized on the canvas. I wrote an article about this technique and how it can be tweaked in many ways to achieve interesting natural looking patterns.

The following illustration is an example of what can be achieved with this system at a higher scale, with some displacement on the aggregate. It was made with TouchDesigner but relies on the exact same algorithm.

## How to use

I suggest than you read the [https://ciphered.xyz/2020/07/21/cyclic-diffusion-limited-aggregation](article) to understand how this sytem works.
